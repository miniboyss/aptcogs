# aptcogs

Various cogs I need for my Discord server.

## Cogs

### Punish

Punish users by quarantining them to a channel. Will automatically create channels and roles on first use of `/punish`.

`/punish` requires the MANAGE_MESSAGES permission. Syntax is `/punish @user`. Feel free to move `#quarantine` to wherever when it is created.
